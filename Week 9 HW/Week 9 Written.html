    <h1>Code Review of Terrance's Chess Game</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>What goes well:<br>
            -Definely appreciate the comment code denoting each code section (and the styling around that comment)<br>
            -Kingdom select screen: I like that you have code that allows the player to rechoose their army after inital selection.<br>
            -Actual Gameplay: Definetely an ambitous choice of project to try to get done in two weeks. I like the vision. Definetely what you have left fully unimplemented (turn indicator + timer for blitz chess) would be perfect additional features to be added come portfolio time.<br>
        <li>Suggestions for improvement:<br>
            -Kingdom select screen: Instead of a alert that pops up to show the army selection, it would be a cool feature to have a modal/transparency toggle that shows the player choice over the army pictures<br>
            -Actual Gameplay:<br>
            --I do notice as a bug that when you click an empty space<br>
            --As a future feature media queries would be a good idea<br>
        <li>Parts of code that could be more clear:<br>
            -If I were to look at this code without any prior information (aka Terrance's Presentation) I would question the inclusion of code for a timer. I am not seeing a timer element present in the actual game when run. But since Terrance did address this in his presentation that he wanted a blitz chess feature, I will make the following suggestions.
        <li>Notable strengths of code's style/approach:<br>
            -Big strength I noticed right off that bat that the code was neatly organized
            -Even if not fully implemented the baseline code is present for the features that are planned (rather than just pseudo code).
